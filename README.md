# DATA221_Assignment3
This repository contain jupyter notebooks with python code answering all of the questions in DATA221 assignment 3

QUESTION 1
Loaded the crime dataset and calculated the descriptive statistics, including the mean, median, standard deviation, and the full range of values. Provided a written interpretation of these results to explain what the statistics indicate about the dataset's characteristics.

QUESTION 2
Generated a histogram and a box plot for the ViolentCrimesPerPop variable to visualize the data distribution. Included a short analysis discussing the  spread, skewness, and if any outliers were present.

QUESTION 3
Imported the kidney disease dataset and broke it up into a feature matrix and a target label column.Performed a 70/30 train-test split using a fixed random state to ensure the results are are the same each time. Explained the necessity of splitting data into separate sets to properly evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

QUESTION 4
Trained a K-Nearest Neighbors  classifier, making k = 5,  and produced predictions based on the test set. Computed the confusion matrix and calculated the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score for the model. Provided a written breakdown of the True/False Positives and Negatives, with a specific focus on why recall is critical when predicting medical outcomes.

QUESTION 5
Developed and trained multiple KNN models using a range of k values (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). Compared the test accuracy across all k values to identify the most effective setting for the model. Summarized of how k affects model performance, specifically addressing the concepts of overfitting versus underfitting when k is too small or too large respectively.
